        "Like every QES practical you have taken this year, begin by copying this notebook to your own Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exam lasts **two hours** (unless you have extra time) and consists of **11 questions**. All questions should be attempted, and are weighted equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exam is open book and you have full access to the internet and any physical notes you bring with you, but **you are not allowed to communicate with any other person or AI interface during the exam**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some questions involve performing operations on the data that are necessary to complete subsequent questions. Where this is the case, we provide a 'shortcut' to skip the question if you have not been able to perform those operations. This provides a pre-processed version of the data that you can use to continue with the exam. There is no penalty to using a shortcut, but for full credit you must write the code to answer the question yourself. If you have attempted the question but end up using the shortcut, you may still receive partial credit for your attempt to the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can either complete the exam on Google Colab or your editor of choice (e.g. VS Code), but note that the exam has only been tested in Google Colab and we can offer no assistance with technical issues arising from attempting the exam outside Google Colab. If you choose to complete the exam using an editor on your own computer, any associated AI-coding aids (e.g. GitHub Copilot) must be disabled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answers to questions might consist of code, text, plots, or a combination of these. A comment in a code cell (prepended by `#`) or the output of some code that you have run (e.g. a printout of a dataframe) are both valid ways to answer a question.\n",
