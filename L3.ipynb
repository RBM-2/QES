    "# Lent Practical 3: The Stommel Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we're going to look at the Stommel Model ([Stommel, 1961](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1961.tb00079.x)) of ocean thermohaline circulation. In context of the system it represents this is still a very simple model, but it is already complex enough that there is no straightforward analytical solution. We will therefore be using entirely numerical methods to explore this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Set-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",

    "<p>Figure 1. The Stommel Model of Ocean Circulation\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of two boxes representing the high-latitude ($H$) and low-latitude ($L$) ocean, which are homogeneous in temperature $T$ and salinity $S$. The model simulates the exchange of water between these two boxes $Q$ driven by density variations between the boxes, which are in turn driven by the temperature and salinity of each box. Changes in salinity are forced by a 'salinity flux', $H$, into each box. Conceptually, this 'salinity flux' represents the balance of evaporation and precipitation at the surface of each box - the high-latitude box is assumed to be a region of net precipitation (i.e. adding fresh water, lowering salinity, $H$ is negative), and the low-latitude box a region of net evaporation (i.e. removing fresh water, increasing salinity, $H$ is positive). This salinity flux establishes a density difference between the boxes, which drives a flow of water between the boxes $Q$, which by definition is considered as poleward surface flow and equatorward deep flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up our model to represent the real-world ocean, with the volume of each box determined by the surface area of the ocean that exists in 'high' and 'low' latitude regions (with a cutoff at ±30° latitude), which is roughly 0.95 and 0.15, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "SA_{Ocean} = 3.58\\times 10^{14}~\\mathrm{m^{2}}\\\\\n",
    "SA_L=SA_{Ocean}\\times 0.85 \\\\\n",
    "SA_H=SA_{Ocean}\\times 0.15 \\\\\n",
    "V_L=S_L \\times D \\\\\n",
    "V_H=S_H \\times D\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $SA_i$ is surface area, $D$ is the average depth of the ocean ($\\mathrm{m}$), $V_i$ is volume ($\\mathrm{m^{3}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seawater Density\n",
    "\n",
    "The density of ocean water in each box can be approximated by linear dependencies on temperature and salinity:\n",
    "$$\\rho=\\rho_0 -\\alpha(T-T_0)+\\beta(S-S_0)$$\n",
    "$\\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $\\beta$ is the haline contraction coefficient, and the subscript ’0’ indicates a reference state.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Think:** \n",
    "> - Based on the equation above how does an increase in temperature impact the density?\n",
    "> - How about an increase in salinity?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ocean Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this relationship, the flow strength, $Q$ ($\\mathrm{m^{3}yr^{-1}}$), between the boxes can be related to the density difference by a linear law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q = k(\\rho_L - \\rho_H) \\\\\n",
    "Q = k(\\alpha(T_L - T_H) - \\beta(S_L - S_H)) \\\\\n",
    "Q = k(\\alpha \\Delta T - \\beta \\Delta S)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is a proportionality coefficient to convert the change in temperature and salinity to a volume flux in meters per year. Based on this relationship answer the following questions:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Think:** \n",
    "> - What temperature and salinity conditions are required to have poleward surface flow ($Q>0$)?\n",
    "> - Which of temperature and salinity are the main drivers in the thermohaline circulation today?\n",
    "> - Can you think of any local (rather than global) processes which might be having different effects on temperature and salinity and contributing to the thermohaline circulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature Relaxation\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature of each box is influenced by the temperature of the overlying atmosphere, relaxing back to the atmosphweric temperature with a characteristic timescale $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dT_i}{dt} = \\frac{T_{atm} - T_i}{\\tau}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Think:** \n",
    "> - If temperature in each box were not influenced by the atmosphwere, what would happen to the temperature in each box over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Salinity Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The salinity flux, $H$, is a slightly trickier concept. In practice, we can derive it from the NET precipitation - evaporation for a box in $\\mathrm{m~yr^{-1}}$. For example, image we have a bucket containing 10L of seawater at 35 g/L salinity, and evaporate 1L of water from it. The salinity of the evaporated water is zero g/L, which effectively means that we have added all the salt from 1L of seawater to the remaining 9L water (i.e. 35 g). We can apply the same logic to calculate the salinity flux in each box, assuming a net precipitation-evaporation of 0.25 m/yr in the high-latitude box, assuming average ocean salinity of 35 g/L. This yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = 0.25 ~ SA_H ~ 35 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $H$ is the same in the high and low latitude boxes because evaporation and precipitation must balance globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put all this information together to write down four equations that describe the evolution of the temperature and salinity in each box:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dT_L}{dt} = \\frac{-Q \\Delta T + \\frac{V_L}{\\tau} (T^{at}_L - T_L)}{V_L} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dT_H}{dt} = \\frac{Q \\Delta T + \\frac{V_H}{\\tau} (T^{at}_H - T_H)}{V_H} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dS_L}{dt} =\\frac{-Q \\Delta S + H}{V_L} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dS_H}{dt} =\\frac{Q \\Delta S - H}{V_H}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Delta T = T_L - T_H$ and $\\Delta S = S_L - S_H$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, you're going to see what happens if you disturb the Stommel model from its equilibrium state. This is a common technique in modelling natural systems - 'forcing' the model with an external variable to see how it responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we want to remove the 'stabilisation' phase that you see at the start of the model run above by initialising the model at the equilibrium state. You can do this by looking at the last values of the state variable arrays, for example `TL[-1]` will return you the low latitude temperature at the end of the model run. Copy your code from the cell above, find out what the steady state values are for the temperature and salinity in each box, and use these as the initial conditions for the model. Check you've done this correctly by running this model. You should see negligible changes in the temperature and salinity in each box through the model run because you've started at the equilibrium state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're happy this is working, we'll start our experiment. We're going to simulate the impact of melting a lot of ice in the high latitude box, leading to a reduction in salinity by 0.002 g/L/yr between years 100-200 of the simulation. To do this, you'll need to add a conditional `if` statement at the end of your `for` loop to modify the high latitude salinity.\n",
