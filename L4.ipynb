As discussed in lectures, we're using a 3-box model because it's the simplest possible configuration that allows us to represent both thermohaline circulation (with a latitudinal density gradient), and the separation of the surface and deep ocean, both of which are necessary to represent carbon in the ocean.\n","\n","Today, you'll be introduced to the overall structure of the model by setting up the transport of two conservative quantities - salt and heat, and their modification by evaporation, precipitation and heat exchange at the surface which will drive water circulation in the model.\n","\n","## Tips for the Term\n","\n"," - We will build up this model gradually. Each of the next three practicals will add one new process to the model. This means that each new practical will contain code that solves the previous practicals.\n"," - It will be much easier to understand the model if you keep up with the practicals through the term, rather than leaving them all to the last minute, because...\n"," - In the last practical you will be given a choice of two questions for the long section of the lab report. Both of these will require you to modify the model you have built to understand some component of the carbon cycle.

There is a single box representing the atmosphere ($A$) overlying both surface boxes. Each box is modelled as a homogeneous mass with uniform physical and chemical properties.\n","\n","The high latitude surface box represents 15% of the total ocean surface area, and has a depth of 200 m. The low latitude box is 85% of the ocean surface area, with a depth of 100 m. This depth difference reflects geographic variation in the depth of the mixed layer, which tends to be deeper at high latitudes where winds are more intense and waves are larger, and shallower in the tropics where there is more temperature-driven stratification.\n","\n","The first step in constructing our model is to set up the processes that will create a density gradient that causes water to circulate around our boxes.\n","This is conceptually similar to the Lorenz and Stommel models you encountered in the last two practicals, but the geometry of our boxes is different to accommodate the inclusion of biogeochemical processes that operate in the surface ocean.\n","\n","### Physical Ocean Model\n","\n","We must include two mixing processes to describe the movement of water around our model:\n","- **Thermohaline Circulation** ($Q_T$) is a unidirectional current that moves a fixed volume from $L \\rightarrow H \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow$ etc. This is driven by density differences between the surface boxes. Water density depends on temperature and salinity, so using the same approach as the last practical we can calculate $Q_T$ as:\n","  $$\n","  Q_T = k (\\alpha \\Delta T - \\beta \\Delta S)\n","  $$\n","  where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ convert changes in T and S into density differences and $k$ is a rate constant.\n","\n","- **Surface-Deep Mixing** exchanges water between the deep and surface ocean and takes place in both high and low latitude surface boxes.
